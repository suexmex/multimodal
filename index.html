									<p>Parents think about what is right for their families. They will do anything to give their children the best life they can give them. Even if it means leaving their families, leaving what is so familiar for something so foreign and unwelcoming. My parents took that chance. They left everything. First my father left when I was only two days born. I did not know who my father was, all I knew was that a man sent me dresses through the mail and I grew up believing that my grandfather was my father. Years passed, 4 years to be exact, before I met the man I would now call papa. But my coming to America left my brothers alone, without a mother or father, and with the memories that we left behind to keep them by.

									<p>Now we are together but with the same fear of being torn apart once more. With the political tension happening on the topic of immigration, many families are being affected, one being my own. My family would again be seen parting away. Due to my parents not having the legal statuses to stay in America, but making sure my sisters and I did, I would be forced to leave behind everything that I had now adapted to... friends, family, and the customs of American life. Everything is put on hold in these types of situations. I can never promise anything to my family because of the risk of having the life that I am now familiar with being taken away from me.

									<p>My sisters grew up with both their mama and papa in their lives, neither of them reaching the age of 12 yet. Parents are an essential part of a childâ€™s life but that is at risk everyday. The risk that my parents will be arrested and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, known as ICE, will come and take them away. This makes it near to impossible for my parents to fight for their parental rights for them not having the same rights as a natural born, or legal, US citizen The reason immigrants move to the United States is to have a better life for them and their kids. But everyday, they are at at chance because of the decisions they make. Good decision or not,  immigration is believed to be the key to success, but with that key comes a storm of unhappiness, because you are separated from the person or people you love, and unpredictability because you can never know what will happen between today and tomorrow. With this key comes lies because of the fear of being outed to the ICE. With this key comes secrets that only a few can keep, that only a family can keep. Secrets that soon turn to refreshed memories of the family they then had to leave behind for the idea of making their lives better.
